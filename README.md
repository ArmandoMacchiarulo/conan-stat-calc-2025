## What’s new in this fork

This version keeps the spirit of the original calculator but updates it for a more modern layout and the newer attribute system.

- ✅ New attribute layout (Strength, Agility, Vitality, Authority, Grit, Expertise)
- ✅ Fully rewritten layout using **flexbox** (no more tables)
- ✅ Progress bar reworked:
  - the perk track still uses tier images (`teir0–4`)
  - a semi-transparent overlay animates smoothly as you spend points
- ✅ Cleaner, more maintainable **CSS** and **JavaScript**
- ✅ Responsive design – behaves better on different resolutions
- ✅ Small UX tweaks (auto-select perks when enough points are invested, clearer perk choices, etc.)
